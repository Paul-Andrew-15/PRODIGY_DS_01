## Customer Purchase Decision Prediction

1. Objective: The project aims to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data using a decision tree classifier.

2. Dataset: The Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is utilized, which includes features such as age, job, marital status, education, default status, balance, housing loan, personal loan, contact method, day, month, duration, campaign, previous days, previous contacts, and the outcome of the previous marketing campaign.

3. Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets to prepare it for modeling.

4. Model Training and Evaluation: A decision tree classifier is trained on the training dataset, and its performance is evaluated on the testing dataset using metrics such as accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

5. Outcome: The project provides insights into the factors influencing customer purchase decisions and demonstrates the effectiveness of decision tree classifiers in predictive modeling for marketing purposes.
